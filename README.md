# AAroN - Analyze Architectures on Neo4j

AAroN is a plug-in for Neo4j to analyze common UML/ArchiMate based architectures on the graph database Neo4j. Currently this Plug-In support the ArchiMate Open Exchange XML Format and the EAP-/EAPX-File Format from the modelling tool Sparx Enterprise Architect. This tool was initially developed for analyzing Enterprise Architectures based on ArchiMate or Sparx Enterprise Architect in combination with the NATO Architecture Framework (NAF). But the tool can be used to analyze any Architecture based on Sparx or ArchiMate.

Maybe some features are not supported yet. Especially if it is not that commonly used in classical enterprise architecture modelling. If you find anything missing please create an issue to request the feature.
